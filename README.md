# cli-valorant-logic

Command line that mocks the logic I want to achieve in Valorant Random

## The Interface

The interface is written in TypeScript. The TS is compiled to JS, and then Node handles the script at run time. Inquirer and the @types/inquirer npm packages are used for the prompting the user.

## Goal

The goal of this project was to get more familiar with TypeScript, and incorporating it into other JS frameworks and libraries. Reflecting back, this is a program that would have maybe taken an hour to do in JavaScript, and I can't imagine how much harder it gets to implement TypeScript with other projects as they become more complex. But once you are fully incorporated, I can see the potential for catching lots of small errors that could occur in much larger projects.
